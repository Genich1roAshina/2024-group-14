## Introduction 
![Rapid-roll-image](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-14/blob/main/report_material/images/rapid-roll.jpg)

Our creative inspiration is drawn from a classic Nokia game called "Rapid Roll." On top of preserving its original fun and entertainment, we have added a map inversion feature: the ball needs to survive by jumping instead of continuing to fall. Throughout the whole game development process, we have engaged in extensive collaboration to find the most suitable development approach for our team. Kanban and agile development principles are very important methodologies we applied during our development, which assist us in constantly reflecting, adjusting, and discussing our plans and next tasks on a weekly basis.

## Requirements
To kick off this unit, we first had an in-person brain-storming session to discuss the kind of games we're interested in and what makes our game idea feasible to create in processing. We generated around 6 well-thought-out game ideas with 3 challenges and a twist associated with each game idea. As a group, we took a unanimous vote and decided on two games, Flappy Butterfly (a variation of Flappy Bird) and Rapid Roll, a falling platformer game. For both games, we collated requirements such as use case diagrams specifications and user stories to further narrow down our choices. These specifications allowed us to develop basic paper prototypes to demonstrate our game in its simplest form - [Flappy Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpQTw_9nIlE) and [Rapid Roll](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/F4jMOeVJRp0). Ultimately, we ended up choosing Rapid Roll as our game as it's complex and challenging enough to develop a suitable twist and keep the players engaged.

### User stories

> "⁠As a player, I want to be able to choose a difficulty level for the game to better suit my style of play"

> "⁠As a player, I want to be able to see a scoreboard and compare myself with my peers"

> "As a player, I want to see my score and lives left on the screen as I play the game"

> "As a player, I want to be warned of the map inversion so that I can prepare myself"

> "⁠⁠As a player, I want to see the rules of the game before playing it, so that I can prepare myself for the challenges ahead"
