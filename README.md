## Introduction 

### Rapid Roll (Final Idea)
![Rapid-roll-image](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-14/blob/main/resources/images/rapid-roll.jpg)

This is a one-player platform game where players control a ball that continuously rolls down a series of platforms without dying. There will be 3 levels, easy, medium and hard and they reflect the speed of the ball as it falls, making the game more challenging, as well as moving platforms and innovative obstacles. Furthermore, based on how many coins the player collects while playing, it will translate to getting more lives, therefore allowing the player to increase their score. Likewise, the platforms will have spikes and be generative, adding further complexity and challenge to the game. 

**Twist**: After an X amount of time, instead of the player falling to avoid spikes, the player will need to jump to avoid them. The map will start ascending and the player will be jumping to avoid the spikes. Moreover, the map will revert to falling, but the player will not know when - adding an element of suspense. 

Challenges:
- Generative Platforming 
- Optimisation for Smooth Gameplay
- Collision Detection and Spikes 

## Requirements

### Ideation Process
To kick off this unit, we first had an in-person brain-storming session to discuss the kind of games we're interested in and what makes our game idea feasible to create in processing. We generated around 6 well-thought-out game ideas with 3 challenges and a twist associated with each game idea. As a group, we took a unanimous vote and decided on two games, Flappy Butterfly (a variation of Flappy Bird) and Rapid Roll, a falling platformer game. For both games, we collated requirements such as use case diagrams specifications and user stories to further narrow down our choices. These specifications allowed us to develop basic paper prototypes to demonstrate our game in its simplest form - [Flappy Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpQTw_9nIlE) and [Rapid Roll](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/F4jMOeVJRp0). Ultimately, we ended up choosing Rapid Roll as our game as it's complex and challenging enough to develop a suitable twist and keep the players engaged.
